#imOK
imOk is an app that facilitates information seeking if someone is ok or not. Our app uses tweets with geotags and the hashtag of imok to determine if someone is ok and their location during or after a natural disaster. 

#Use Cases
1. You have a device with internet access you would tweet your full name with the hashtag imok
2. Someone you know that does not have a device with internet access is ok, you can tweet on their behalf to alert that they are ok
3. You are wondering if someone you know is ok or not, you search their name on the app to see if they are ok along with their last known location.
